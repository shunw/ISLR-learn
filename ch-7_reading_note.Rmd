####Purpose: 
Fit non-linear model
####Data: 
Wage in library(ISLR)

| No. | Regression | relation/ merit | Suggestion |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Polynomial regression (Page 280) | --- | unusual to use d greater than 3 or 4 because of overly flexible |
| 2 | Step functions (Page 282) | --- |
| 3 | Regression splines | extension of item 1 and item 2, => flexible than them |
| 4 | Smoothing splines | similar to item 3 |
| 5 | Local regression | similar to item 3 and item, one important difference, regions are allowed to overlap |
| 6 | Generalized additive models | allow us to extend the methods all above to deal w/ multiple predictors |
