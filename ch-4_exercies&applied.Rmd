2. It was stated in the text that classifying an observation to the class
for which (4.12) is largest is equivalent to classifying an observation
to the class for which (4.13) is largest. Prove that this is the case. In
other words, under the assumption that the observations in the kth
class are drawn from a N(μk, σ2) distribution, the Bayes’ classifier
assigns an observation to the class for which the discriminant function
is maximized.

--- not sure how to demonstrate this.

10 This question should be answered using the Weekly data set, which
is part of the ISLR package. This data is similar in nature to the
Smarket data from this chapter’s lab, except that it contains 1, 089
weekly returns for 21 years, from the beginning of 1990 to the end of
2010.

(a) Produce some numerical and graphical summaries of the Weekly
data. Do there appear to be any patterns?

-- from the pairs, we could see the (year and volume), (today and direction) have strong relationship, maybe the (volume and today) has some relationship. 
```{r}
install.packages("ISLR")
library(ISLR)
head(Weekly)
dim(Weekly)
```
```{r, echo=FALSE}
pairs(Weekly)
plot(Weekly$Volume ~ Weekly$Year)
```

(b) Use the full data set to perform a logistic regression with
Direction as the response and the five lag variables plus Volume
as predictors. Use the summary function to print the results. Do
any of the predictors appear to be statistically significant? If so,
which ones?

-- Lag2 shows the statistically significant.  
```{r}
names(Weekly)
weekly.fit = glm(Direction ~ Lag1 + Lag2 + Lag3 + Lag4 + Lag5 + Volume, data = Weekly, family = "binomial")
summary(weekly.fit)
```

(c) Compute the confusion matrix and overall fraction of correct predictions. Explain what the confusion matrix is telling you about the types of mistakes made by logistic regression.

-- the correct rate is around 56%, which should be lower if apply the regression into the actual condition. 
```{r}
weekly.pre = predict(weekly.fit, Weekly, type = "response")
weekly.res = rep("Down", length(weekly.pre))
weekly.res[weekly.pre > .5] = "Up"
direction.label = Weekly$Direction
contrasts(Weekly$Direction)
table(weekly.res, direction.label)
mean(weekly.res == direction.label)
557/(557+430)
54/(54+48)
```

(d) Now fit the logistic regression model using a training data period from 1990 to 2008, with Lag2 as the only predictor. Compute the confusion matrix and the overall fraction of correct predictions for the held out data (that is, the data from 2009 and 2010).

--the error rate is similar as the (c) part, which also shows that only with Lag2 also could make the similar prediction. 
```{r}
weekly.train = Weekly[which(Weekly$Year>=1990 & Weekly$Year<=2008), ]
weekly.test = Weekly[which(Weekly$Year<1990 | Weekly$Year>2008),]
weekly.glm_1 = glm(Direction ~ Lag2, data = weekly.train, family = "binomial")
weekly.pre_1 = predict(weekly.glm_1, Weekly, type = "response")
weekly.res_1 = rep("Down", length(weekly.pre_1))
weekly.res_1[weekly.pre_1>.5] = "Up"
table(weekly.res_1, direction.label)
mean(weekly.res_1 == direction.label)
580/(452+580)
32/(32+25)
```

--result is almost the same a the glm result according to the table result. 
(e) Repeat (d) using LDA.
```{r}
library(MASS)
weekly.lda = lda(Direction ~ Lag2, data = weekly.train)
weekly.lda.pre = predict(weekly.lda, Weekly, type = "response")
table(weekly.lda.pre$class, direction.label)
mean(weekly.lda.pre$class == direction.label)
```

(f) Repeat (d) using QDA.
-- the result is different than the lda and glm, there is no "down" estimation. it seems the regression is linear not suitable for the quadratic regression. 
```{r}
weekly.qda = qda(Direction ~ Lag2, data = weekly.train)
weekly.qda.per = predict(weekly.qda, Weekly, type = "response")
table(weekly.qda.per$class, direction.label)
mean(weekly.qda.per$class == direction.label)
```

(g) Repeat (d) using KNN with K = 1.
-- the error rate is much lower than all the regression before. So I guess the regression is neither linear nor quadratic. which is much like un-regular one. 
Checked error rate by increasing k. higher k leads to higher error rate. 
```{r}
train.X = cbind(weekly.train$Lag2)
test.X = cbind(Weekly$Lag2)
train.direction = weekly.train$Direction
test.direction = Weekly$Direction

library(class)
# for k = 1
weekly.knn = knn(train.X, test.X, train.direction, k = 1)
table(weekly.knn, test.direction)
mean(weekly.knn == test.direction)

# for k = 5
weekly.knn = knn(train.X, test.X, train.direction, k = 5)
table(weekly.knn, test.direction)
mean(weekly.knn == test.direction)

# for k = 10
weekly.knn = knn(train.X, test.X, train.direction, k = 10)
table(weekly.knn, test.direction)
mean(weekly.knn == test.direction)

plot(Weekly$Lag2 ~ Weekly$Year)
```

(h) Which of these methods appears to provide the best results on this data?
-- it seems the knn provides the best result on the data. 

(i) Experiment with different combinations of predictors, including possible transformations and interactions, for each of the methods. Report the variables, method, and associated confusion matrix that appears to provide the best results on the held out data. Note that you should also experiment with values for K in the KNN classifier.

-- checked by adding other predictors, but the p value is not significant for other predictors. And also trying the interact with Year/ Volume/ etc, but the interactions are also not significant. It seems only Lag1 and Lag2 are most significant. Need to check the answers and see if there is any other methods other than try one by one. 

?? need to check the transformation for the next step. 
```{r}
weekly.glm.try = glm(Direction ~ Lag1 + Volume * Today, data = weekly.train, family = "binomial")
summary(weekly.glm.try)
```




Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
