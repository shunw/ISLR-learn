2. It was stated in the text that classifying an observation to the class
for which (4.12) is largest is equivalent to classifying an observation
to the class for which (4.13) is largest. Prove that this is the case. In
other words, under the assumption that the observations in the kth
class are drawn from a N(??k, ??2) distribution, the Bayes' classifier
assigns an observation to the class for which the discriminant function
is maximized.

--- not sure how to demonstrate this.

10 This question should be answered using the Weekly data set, which
is part of the ISLR package. This data is similar in nature to the
Smarket data from this chapter's lab, except that it contains 1, 089
weekly returns for 21 years, from the beginning of 1990 to the end of
2010.

(a) Produce some numerical and graphical summaries of the Weekly
data. Do there appear to be any patterns?


```{r}
install.packages("ISLR")
library(ISLR)
head(Weekly)
dim(Weekly)

plot(Weekly$Volume ~ Weekly$Year)
```


from the pairs, we could see the (year and volume), (today and direction) have strong relationship, maybe the (volume and today) has some relationship. 
```{r, echo=FALSE}
pairs(Weekly)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
